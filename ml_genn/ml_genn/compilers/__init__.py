"""Compilation in mlGeNN refers to the process of converting 
:class:`ml_genn.Network` and :class:`ml_genn.SequentialNetwork`
objects into a GeNN model which can be simulated. This module contains a
variety of compiler classes which create GeNN models for inference and
training as well as several compiled model classes which can be subsequently
used to interact with the GeNN models.
